libcds implements low-level succinct data structures such as bitmaps,
sequences, permutations, etc. The main goal is to provide a set of
structures that form the building block of most compressed/succinct
solutions. In the near future we are planning to add compression
algorithms and support for succinct trees.

Right now we are just fixing bugs and testing some new things in here,
but most of the effort is being put into libcds2, this rewrite aims at
solving many problems with 64bits systems. This is necessary in order
to index bigger inputs.
